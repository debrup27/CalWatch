Problem Statement 1: Weave AI magic with Groq

## 🎯 Objective

Maintaining a healthy lifestyle is challenging, and many fitness apps fail to provide personalized support, clear progress tracking, and meaningful rewards. CalWatch solves this by combining AI with emotional support. Through Padma, the AI Nutritionist, users receive tailored advice, motivation, and recognition based on their habits and goals.

CalWatch also introduces Monad Transactions, creating a transparent record of achievements. Users earn Streak tokens on the Stellar blockchain, giving their milestones real-world value. This unique approach keeps users engaged, motivated, and connected to their fitness journey.
